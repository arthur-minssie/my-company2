				<h2>What is street workout ?</h2>
				<p>
					Street workout is a sport leisure activity combining gymnastics and weight training. Mixing figures of strength, flexibility, balance and agility, street workout is practiced mainly outdoors. 
				</p>
				<h2>The history:</h2>
				<p>
					The historical origins of street workout seem diverse and sometimes controversial. The movements and techniques of street workout also derive from various worldwide callisthenics and gymnastics movements, as well as modern body weight training techniques.
				</p>
				<h2>Practising:</h2>
				<p>
					Street workout consists of conditioning the body through weight training and often the use of gymnastic movements. Street workout training can consist of pull-ups, squats, push-ups, dips, etc. With or without equipment, the condition required in principle is to train outdoors for it to be street workout although the practice differs from other sports more by the style of the discipline itself rather than by the place where it is practiced.

					Street workout is in the vast majority of cases practiced solely by body weight, with different techniques to increase the resistance and the difficulty of the training, allowing a street workout practitioner to become very strong without using equipment. For example, assistance techniques can be used for tractions, to be able to progressively learn how to do one-armed tractions, using elastic bands for example, which require a high level of strength.
